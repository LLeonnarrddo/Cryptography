â€“ Blockchain Implementation

This is a practical assignment that can be done by groups of two students. The purpose is to
explore existing Blockchain technologies/tools and their applications, using freely available
tools that can be found on the Internet, to construct a simple, working blockchain.
Alternatively, a new blockchain solution may be developed/implemented. The assignment
should include:
- identification and description of the tool used or developed in the assignment;
- detailed description/specification of the selected use case;
- detailed description of the use case implementation;
- An analysis of the pros and cons of the used or developed blockchain tool.
The project encompasses two deliveries:
1. An intermediate delivery, which will be mainly focused on the specification/design
of the used or developed blockchain tool and use case, although it may also
comprise any initial analysis and implementation. The students should hand in a
single zip file with a report on the developed work, as well as any developed code.
This phase will require an estimated effort of 20 hours and has a weight of 4/20 on
the final course grade.
2. A final delivery, comprising a full specification/design, implementation, analysis, and
use examples. The students should hand in a single zip file with the final report on
the developed work, as well as the developed code. This phase will require an
estimated effort of 32 hours and has a weight of 6/20 on the final course grade.
